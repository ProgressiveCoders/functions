## Items to Consider Before Submitting Your Proposal

Following are best practice steps and requirements for contributing your community Operations (or functions) idea to the ProgCode community for consideration. If you want to submit a tech idea to the community, please follow the **New Partners Best Practices Guide, [**here**](https://github.com/ProgressiveCoders/projects/projects/1)

### Problem / Description (Required)
Please describe your idea or proposal. What is the problem your **proposed change** may solve?

### Solution (Best Practice Option)
Briefly describe how your idea or proposal how might enhance the community _(i.e., streamline existing processes, increase community engagement, distribute operations tasks, make ProgCode more inclusive, etc.)_.

### Mission Alignment (Required)
Briefly describe how your proposal aligns with ProgCode's core mission to remove or reduce the influence of big money in politics by supporting the creation of open source software to empower the grassroots.

### Plan (Best Practice Option)
Provide a short step-by-step process for implementing your plan in order of priority. Include specific tasks and action items, names of the members who would complete those tasks, expected delivery date or deadlines. _(It's helpful to include check boxes. You may copy and paste the sample list below into your new Functions issue)._ 
- [ ] Step One.
- [ ] Step Two.

### Consent & Decision Making (Best Practice Option) 

Is your proposal meant only for community discussion at this time? Do you seek a vote for consent to continue researching/exploring your proposed idea, or do you seek a vote for consent to implement your proposal? For further guidance, please review our current **[Change Process](https://github.com/ProgressiveCoders/functions/wiki/Change-Process)**. Don't hesitate to ask team members for clarification in the #operations channel on Slack!

_If left blank, your proposal will be listed for discussion on the next week's [**Operations Agenda**](http://progco.de/ops-agenda) and scheduled for vote at a later date, per the notifications requirements set forth in the Change Process.)_

### Additional Information (Best Practice Option)
This is a free-form area, but could be used for links to documents, videos, studies, statistics or proof of concept which help bolster your proposal.

### Reference Link(s) (Best Practice Option)
This is a free-form area, but could be used for links to the Progressive Coders Wiki, existing Operations Functions Issues addressing similar problems, etc.

### Once you are ready to submit your proposal:
1. Create a GitHub Account. _(Don't have one yet? Create one [**here**](https://github.com/join)_!
2. Create a new GitHub Functions Issue, [**here**](https://github.com/ProgressiveCoders/functions/issues/new). Be sure to tag ProgCode Operations Staff (@adcor, @jbp5013, @PamelaJohn and @stephenscapelliti) in your new issue so that your idea can be included on the Operations Agenda for next week.
3. Attend the next Operations Meeting to discuss the merits of your proposal with the community. _Operations Meetings are held every Monday at 8pm ET (US). If you are outside the US, you may in attending the Operations Planning Meeting which is held each Monday at 10pm GMT/9pm BST (UK), more convenient. If neither of these times works for you, let us know in the #operations Slack channel and the Operations team can schedule a recorded Zoom call at a mutually convenient time and share the recording at the regularly scheduled Monday Operations Meeting. For more details about Operations Meetings and how to participate, read Page One of the Operations Meeting Agenda, [**here**](http://progco.de/ops-agenda)._
