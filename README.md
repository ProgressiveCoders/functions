Progressive Coders Network is a non-hierarchical community whose mission is to remove or reduce the impact of big money in politics by supporting the creation of open source tools to empower the grassroots. As such the ideas and suggestions of each ProgCode member are valued from the first day you become a member. Members may add any topic to the weekly Operations Meeting Agenda by creating a new Issue on the Functions board, [here](https://github.com/ProgressiveCoders/functions/issues/new).
