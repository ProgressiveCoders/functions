## ProgCode Operations Team Functions
[**Progressive Coders Network**](https://progcode.org) is a non-partisan, [**non-hierarchical**](https://medium.com/progressive-coders-network/structure-of-the-tyrannyless-37007b5ac7f5) community of technologists and (frequently non-coding!) tech support volunteers whose mission is to remove or reduce the impact of big money in politics by supporting the creation of open source tools to empower the grassroots. 

The ProgCode community operates from the bottom up. As such, organizational ideas and suggestions of each ProgCode member are valued from the first day you become a member. Members may add any topic to the weekly Operations Meeting Agenda at any time by creating a new Issue on the Operations Team Functions board. You will find detailed instructions for submitting your idea on the [**Contributions Page**](https://github.com/ProgressiveCoders/functions/blob/master/contributing.md) of this repository.

## Thank you for your interest in learning how to contribute to this amazing community!
